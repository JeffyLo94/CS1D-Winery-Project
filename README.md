# CS1D-Winery-Project
CS1D Project - Shortest Distance between Wineries + Directory

In this project I served as the product owner. 

I managed stories with Jazz Hub’s agile management tools. I created and managed the backlog. I also created the Winery class UML. In the program, I created most methods (constructors, accessors, and mutators) and overall utility of the Winery Class. This included the decision to return pointer to vector containers for Wineries distances and wines. This winery class is the backbone of the project, as nearly every main function of the program uses this class. I also contributed mutator and accessor methods in the Wine Class to access the
wine object’s year and price. I was also responsible for the Add and Modify Wines section of the Administrator Console. I both created both the front end and back end for this section. The Add Wine section involved many checks on the user input to guarantee uniquely named wines, non-negative prices, and possible years. I tried to make the Add Wine section more user friendly with the live updating of the wine list. The Edit Wines performs many similar checks as the add wine. In addition to this, I designed the Canyon Villa Logo used in the program. I also contributed to work on the overall UI format. Lastly I worked on the ReadFromFile function as part of the persistence of data for our program.
